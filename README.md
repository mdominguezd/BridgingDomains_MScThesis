# Objective
The overall objective of this thesis is to assess the performance of adversarial domain adaptation techniques for increasing the generalization capabilities of deep learning models for Cashew crop mapping.


# Research questions
1. How much does the domain shift between source and target affect the accuracy of a cashew crop mapping model trained only with source data and applied in the target domain?
2. To what extent do adversarial domain adaptation methods impact the accuracy and the generalization capability of semantic segmentation models used for cashew crop mapping?
